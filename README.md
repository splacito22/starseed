# 09 Starseed, Node.js: Professional README Generator

​

## Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application that simplifies the process of creating high-quality README files for your GitHub projects. With just a few prompts, you can generate a well-structured README that includes essential sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contributing information, tests, and more. Save time and ensure consistency in your project documentation by automating the README creation process.

## Tasks

Setting Up Project Structure: Create the required files and folders. Ensure the project is well-organized for efficient development.
Installing Dependencies: Install the 'inquirer' package using npm to enable user interaction. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed for the application.
Creating User Prompts: Create an array of questions to collect user input effectively. Ensure the prompts cover all required sections of a high-quality README.
Generating README Content: Write a function to generate README content based on user input. Structure the content to ensure it follows best practices for README files.
Writing README to File: Implement a function to write the generated README content to a file. Verify that the README file is created successfully and contains the correct content.
Initializing the Application: Develop an initialization function that guides users through the process. Ensure the application runs smoothly, guiding users through the necessary steps.
